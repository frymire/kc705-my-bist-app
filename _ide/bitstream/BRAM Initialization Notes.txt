After generating the bitstream and exporting hardware from within Vivado, copy <platform project>/hw/kc705-my-bist.bit into this folder. Then, you call update_mem to initialize the BRAM contents using the Hello.mem file. 

From Vitis, select Xilinx -> Vitis Shell. Go to the <applicaton project>\_ide\bitstream folder, and then call:

	updatemem -meminfo kc705-my-bist.mmi -data Hello.mem -proc design_1_i/uB -bit kc705-my-bist.bit -out kc705-my-bist-with-rom.bit

Add the -force option if you are sure you're ready to overwrite an existing bit file.

You can then add the elf file as usual from within Vitis, but be sure you are using the kc705-my-bist-with-rom.bit file.
